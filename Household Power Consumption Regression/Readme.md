## AIM:
### Prediction task is to determine Total electricity consumption for a household.
1. Carry out a detailed EDA.
2. Use Regression: linear regression, Lassos, Ridge, Elastic, SVM

### Tools and libraries:

* Python
	- Pandas
	- Numpy
	- Pyplot
	- Seaborn
	- Scikit learn

## Inferences

We were successfully able to predict the consumption of electricity for each household. We achieved a R-square score of 73.58% by using SVR.
