# 👨‍👨‍👦‍👦Census Income Dataset Classification

## Data source :
* Data was taken from [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).

## AIM :
### Prediction task is to determine whether a person makes over 50K a year.
1. Carry out a detailed EDA.
2. Use Classification: logistic regression, SVM(kernels)

### Tools and libraries:

* Python
	- Pandas
	- Numpy
	- Pyplot
	- Seaborn
	- Scikit learn

## Inferences

We were successfully able to predict if the salary is above or below 50K. The best model is SVC with rbf kernel. We achieved an accuracy of 85% after hyper parameter tuning.
