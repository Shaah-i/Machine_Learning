# ðŸ”¥Algerian Forest Fires Dataset Logistic Regression


## Data source :
* Data was taken from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/algerian+forest+fires+dataset).


## AIM :
### To perdict the Classes (fire or not fire) using Logistic regression and evaluating the models based on prefomance metrics.
1. If the data is imbalanced evaluate using precission and recall.
2. Convert the data into balanced data and get acurracy more than 90%.


### Tools and libraries:

* Python
	- Pandas
	- Numpy
	- Pyplot
	- Seaborn
	- Scikit learn (logistic regression)

## Inferences

As the dataset was balanecd we directly proceeded second problem statment.

We were successfully able to predict Classes values for imbalance data with the performance metrics as follows :
accuracy = 95.94%
precision = 97.14%
recall = 94.44%
f2 score = 94.97%

We were able to achieve accuracy greater than 90%
