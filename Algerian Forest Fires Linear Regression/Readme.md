# ðŸ”¥Algerian Forest Fires Dataset Linear Regression


## Data source :
* Data was taken from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/algerian+forest+fires+dataset).


## AIM :
### To perdict the temperature using Linear regression and evaluating the models based on prefomance metrics.


### Tools and libraries:

* Python
	- Pandas
	- Numpy
	- Pyplot
	- Seaborn
	- Scikit learn (linear regression)

## Inferences

MAE : 1.34
MSE : 2.9
RMSE : 1.7
R2 : 0.69
Adjusted R2 : 0.57

We were successfully able to predict Temperature values with an adjusted R2 of 0.57.
